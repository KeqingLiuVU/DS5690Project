# Overview

**Challenge:** Applying for more than 50 jobs to secure interviews is time-consuming, requiring at least one minute per application. This represents a significant time investment with limited personal development benefits. 

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to create an application that automates the process of applying for easy-apply jobs on LinkedIn using my personal information, saving valuable time.

**Approach**: The project integrates two key components:

1. A workflow to interact with the LinkedIn website and automate the job application process.
   
2. An AI-powered system to generate and fill answers for application questions during the process.

# Presentation materials

The project features a Streamlit App for demonstration.

# Model card/dataset card

Due to the sensitive nature of this data, it is not included in the public repository.
